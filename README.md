Modifications- 
1) 2 Complete Levels with their own styles- The first one introduces the player to the basic mechanics of the game and can also be used to figure out controls for the newer mechanics .  The second level has you utilizing the newer mechanics to a higher degree. 

2) Logical Progression in the Game - The first level has you finding keys for the various doors around the level by using basic platforming and at some places the jetpack and the attack. The keys are located in the corner of the map and the player has to be careful while trying to find them as enemies lurk around every corner.

The Second Level has the player Navigating through acid pools and using the jetpack and the attack primarily to reach the end and proceed. The enemies are all flying in your path so combine the jetpack and the attack to win.

3) New Player Ability Jetpack- Jetpack can be used by pressing or holding the spacebar after jumping. This creates a fire effect underneath the jetpack. It can propel the player upward and is required to reach certain areas of the map. The jetpack uses Fuel which can be seen in the Game UI in the form of a fuel bar. You can refuel by either standing on the ground or finding a Refueler pickup. You can also find a MaxFuelIncrease which increases the maximum fuel you can hold at once.

4) New Player Ability Attack - Attack can be used by pressing or holding the J button. This creates a Slash effect in front of the player. If any enemy comes in the range of this effect then they take 1 damage. The attack is on a small cooldown and can't be used continuously. Enemies that have been attacked also create a small flashing or blinking effect.

5) New Pickups- The two new pickups are used to help the player get refuelled or have it so that the maximum fuel in their tank gets increased.

6) Blink Effect - A graphical effect that is created whenever the enemy collides with the attack. This makes it so that for a (very)small duration the enemy's colour alpha goes to 0 and then is shifted back to default.

7) Game UI addition- A Fuel Bar that decreases as you use the Jetpack. The bar is connected to the Player's Fuel and MaxFuel attributes. As it decreases you can notice a slight gradient that also appears which turns the fuel bar from an orange colour to a light yellow.
